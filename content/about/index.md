Hi, I'm Zach! I'm a grad student researcher at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I currently work in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) applying ML to medical and neuroscientific data -- mainly brain MRI, endoscopic feeds, fMRI, and EEG. I'm also intersted in dimensionality reduction, control theory, optimization, and robotics. I am always open to new research opportunities, especially those that align with my interests.

Check out my projects to see what I'm working on!

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, with a minor in applied math. I expect to complete my masters in computer science from Vandy in May 2022.

Outside of work, I enjoy exercise, poetry, books, games, and friends.
