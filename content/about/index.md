<figcaption>Hi, I'm Zach!</figcaption>

I love science and solving problems. I'm currently a graduate student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) at Vanderbilt University applying ML to medical and neuroscientific data -- mainly brain MRI, endoscopic feeds, fMRI, and EEG. I'm also interested in dimensionality reduction, control theory, optimization, and robotics. 

Check out my projects to see what I'm working on!

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my masters in computer science from Vandy in May 2022. My hometown is Austin, TX.

Outside of research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, haiku,  cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo.

I am always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu.
