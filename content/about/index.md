I engineer new methods to process high-dimensional signals, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging, with direct practical benefit. My research spans **signal processing**, **deep learning**, and **machine perception** to solve challenging problems in autonomous systems. Generally, I'm curious about [AI](/tags/ai)/[ML](/tags/ml) & [neuroscience](/tags/neuro), [intelligent systems](/tags/cps) & [robotics](/tags/robotics), and [optimization](/tags/opt) & [control](/tags/control). 

 <strong>I'm an incoming [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) PhD student at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) on a Cockrell Engineering Fellowship working with [Prof. Jon Tamir](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/) in the [Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/csilab.html).</strong> I'm currently a graduate student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) advised by [Prof. Ipek Oguz](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ipek-oguz).

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my M.S. in computer science, also at Vandy, in May 2022. I'm writing my thesis on a deep learning-based segmentation system for surgical endoscopy. 

I'm passionate about connecting with youth and the broader community on topics of science and engineering. During undergrad, I was a mentor in the [VUSE Design Studio](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/designstudio/) and served as the communications chair in my senior year. I was also a section leader & reviewer for the [Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal](https://vurj.vanderbilt.edu) for natural sciences and then served as a graduate mentor. Currently, I'm serving as the community outreach chair for [Out in Engineering](https://anchorlink.vanderbilt.edu/organization/outinengineering). 

Over the past couple of years, I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, AI, and currently projects in ML.

I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, [kū & photography](/kus/), [hendiadys](/notes/hendiadys), esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs.

I am a Lusophone > Hispanophone > Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal. 

My hometown is Austin, TX.
