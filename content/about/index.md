<figcaption>Hi, I'm Zach!</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm an [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) PhD student at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) working with [Prof. Jon Tamir](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/) in the [Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/csilab.html).

My research focuses on **computer vision** for **inverse problems** in **computational imaging**. Specifically, I'm interested in developing **generative** and **physics-informed** models to improve **image reconstruction** in **complex imaging systems**. Generally, I'm curious about [AI](/tags/ai)/[ML](/tags/ml) & [neuroscience](/tags/neuro), [optimization](/tags/opt) & [control](/tags/control), and [intelligent systems](/tags/cps) & [robotics](/tags/robotics).  

Check out my [projects](/projects/) to see what I'm working on, [notes](/notes/) to see what I'm thinking about, and [kū](/kus/) to see what I'm seeing!

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations within my interests. You can contact me at <zstoebner@austin.utexas.edu>.

I graduated from [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) in 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math, and then again in 2022 with my M.S. in computer science. I was a student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) advised by [Prof. Ipek Oguz](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ipek-oguz).  

I'm passionate about connecting with the broader community on topics of science and engineering. During undergrad, I was a mentor in the [VUSE Design Studio](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/designstudio/). I was also a reviewer, section leader, and graduate mentor for the [Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal](https://vurj.vanderbilt.edu).  

I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, AI, and ML projects.

I enjoy [kū & photography](/kus/), [hendiadys](/notes/hendiadys), esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, friendship, heavy weights, and trail runs.

I am an Anglophone > Lusophone > Hispanophone > Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of personal and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal before undergrad.  

My hometown is Austin, TX.
