I leverage machine learning to solve challenging problems in neuroscience, computer vision, & intelligent systems. I'm currently a graduate student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) at Vanderbilt University investigating applied ML to medical and neuroscientific data. Generally, my interests are ML & neuroscience, intelligent systems & robotics, and optimization & control theory.

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my masters in computer science from Vandy in May 2022.

During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, and currently AI.

Outside of research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, haiku & senryu, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo and write a haiku or senryu to pair with it. I especially like to take shameless photoshoots of my cats, Amie and Chaussure (Sir for short). 

I am a Lusophone > Hispanophone > Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal. 

My hometown is Austin, TX.

I am always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu.
