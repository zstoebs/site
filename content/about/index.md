I leverage machine learning to solve challenging problems in neuroscience, computer vision, & intelligent systems. I'm currently a graduate student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) investigating applied ML for medical and neuroscientific data. Generally, I'm curious about ML & neuroscience, intelligent systems & robotics, and optimization & control theory.

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my M.S. in computer science, also at Vandy, in May 2022. <b>Currently, I am applying to PhD programs that encourage interdisciplinary research at the intersection of my interests. Please reach out to me at [+15125477486](tel:+15125477486) or zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu if you would like to work with me!</b> 

During undergrad, I was a mentor in the [VUSE Design Studio](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/designstudio/). I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, deep learning, and currently AI.

Beyond research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, [haiku & senryu](/kus/), [hendiadys](/notes/hendiadys), esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo and write a [kū](/kus/) to pair with it. I especially like to take shameless photoshoots of my cats, Amie and Chaussure. 

I am a Lusophone > Hispanophone > Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal. 

My hometown is Austin, TX, and I hope one day I can live there again as a scientist guiding the future of tech.

I am always open to new opportunities, especially those that align with my interests. You can contact me at zachary.a.stoebner@vanderbilt.edu.
