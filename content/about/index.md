I love science and solving problems. I'm currently a graduate student researcher in [VISE MedICL](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/zachary-stoebner/) at Vanderbilt University applying ML to medical and neuroscientific data -- mainly brain MRI, endoscopic feeds, fMRI, and EEG. I'm also interested in dimensionality reduction, cyberphysical systems, control theory, optimization, and robotics. 

Check out my [projects](/projects/) to see what I'm working on!

I graduated from Vandy in May 2021 with a B.S. in computer science and neuroscience, minoring in applied math. I expect to complete my masters in computer science from Vandy in May 2022.

During undergrad, I was a mentor in the VUSE Design Studio. I have had the privilege to assist with courses on discrete structures, operating systems, and deep learning.

Outside of research, I enjoy heavy weights, friendship, haiku & senryu, hendiadys, esports, kombucha, cucumber cocktails, and sunset runs. Occasionally, I take a good photo and write a haiku or senryu to pair with it.  

I am a Lusophone > Hispanophone > Francophone. I self-studied Portuguese throughout high school, then I took a crucial gap year of emotional and linguistic growth in Lisbon, Portugal. 

My hometown is Austin, TX.
