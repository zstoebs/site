## Past:   -->

- Jan 2026: I've advanced to candidacy!

- May - Sep 2025: I interned at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) in the Bay Area as an AI/ML research intern for [Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/?media=featured), working on structured state-space models for long-form text-to-image/video generation.  

- Nov 15, 2024: I presented a poster at the [6G@UT](https://wncg.org) Student Research Showcase on [Generalized system identification and joint signal reconstruction with implicit neural representations, with application to MRI](/doc/ZachStoebner_sysidINR_poster.pdf).

- Oct 3, 2024: I presented a poster at the [Oden SciML Workshop](https://sites.utexas.edu/scimlworkshop/) on [Generalized system identification and joint signal reconstruction with implicit neural representations, with application to MRI](/doc/ZachStoebner_sysidINR_poster.pdf).

- Jul 29, 2024: Asilomar 2024 accepted our paper [INFusion: Diffusion Regularized Implicit Neural Representations for 2D and 3D accelerated MRI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13895).  

- Dec 25, 2023: IEEE-TDSC published our journal paper [Reducing Malware Analysis Overhead with Coverings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10373111).  

- Oct 15-21, 2023: I attended the i2i Workshop and participated in the MRI4All Hackathon on the reconstruction team, during which 4 teams worked on building an ultra-low-field MRI in a week.  

- Sep 28, 2022: Human Brain Mapping accepted our paper [Comprehensive shape analysis of the cortex in Huntington's disease](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hbm.26125).  

- Aug 25, 2022: I started my PhD at UT Austin with Prof. Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing & Imaging Lab!

- Jul 15, 2022: I successfully defended my thesis [A deep-learning enabled automatic segmentation system for surgical endoscopy](https://www.proquest.com/openview/ab7683e644b5270f828f3d6f91a6b569/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) for my MS in CS at Vanderbilt University.  

- May 13, 2022: I graduated from Vanderbilt University with a BS in CS & Neuroscience, minoring in Applied Math.

- Apr 4, 2022: SPIE 2022 published our paper [Segmentation of kidney stones in endoscopic video feeds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.14175).
