## fall

spiraling nebula <br>
at different speeds <br>
cars in reverse <br>

these trees <br>
bless me with their leaves <br>
partly breezy today <br>

<img src="image/botanic.jpeg" />

an evening ray of sun <br>
illuminates swarming gnats <br>
-- the fountain’s patter <br>

skylight orange hue <br>
relaxing caress of air, <br>
nature’s sublime kiss <br>

## winter

magnolia tree - <br>
solving a boulder problem <br>
in the front yard <br>

two cigarette butts <br>
wedging deep into cedar bark <br>
-- cold, cold heart <br>

in the roll of a wave <br>
the washing oak branches above <br>
carry me to the clouds <br>
