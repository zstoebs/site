quiet and rainy <br>
windows are closed, but listen <br>
world solitude <br>

devotion -- <br>
	sun that invites you <br>
			upon inspection <br>

seated on winter grass -- <br>
computer juxtaposed <br>
for final studies <br>

this is a coup <br>
trump = white supremacy <br>
is domestic terrorism <br>

carbonation, <br>
sip the popping bubbles <br>
winter rainfall <br>

snow not sticking -- <br>
a son honors his father <br>
claiming his mantle <br>

screen replays  <br>
gaming loops before me <br>
day lost to clouds <br>

watching romances <br>
traces of myself <br>
in every lip’s furl <br>

surprise, my kidneys! <br>
who knows what occurs <br>
beneath skin <br>

tree in the wind <br>
just so happy <br>
to be here <br>

bright clouds, cold blue : <br>
dark window opened <br>
growth of epochs <br>

cold inspection <br>
for the cold veggie harvest <br>
-- in warm clothes <br>
the repeat burglar saunters <br>
through those aisles again <br>
