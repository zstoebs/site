## spring

springtails circle <br>
withering stalks of mint <br>
-- trees dance the Wind <br>

humid dew <br>
skin feels all pains <br>
deeply, in air <br>
weeks with many endings <br>
different shadows now <br>

old poems <br>
one slow one <br>
on the nose <br>

two women, sneezing <br>
squirrel traipsing on wire <br>
greeting mosquitoes <br>

## summer

towering above <br>
overtaking all observed <br>
rushing to the end <br>

never-ending flow <br>
the earth’s cold grasp, below <br>
ready for the end <br>

warring wasps <br>
finding a way back <br>
a poisoned home <br>

incarcerated house <br>
forsaken daughter wages <br>
god’s return, in Time <br>

slow day <br>
beneath strong wind <br>
restless peace <br>

<img src="image/leaves.jpeg"/>

soft twilight <br>
moisture in my breath <br>
chirp, chirp, hidden <br>

curious cardinal <br>
upon on leafy bough <br>
hovering to ground <br>

invert wooden corner <br>
spider webs a wee ant <br>
in mosquito humidity <br>

age unknown <br>
beneath my feet <br>
a Spanish cypress <br>

wade out <br>
stumbling on sand dip <br>
beneath the break <br>

moment of sadness, <br>
the problem-solving teacher <br>
waxing wasp’s nest <br>

vapor bombards skin : <br>
trio of house sparrows <br>
resilient, wooden <br>

soft strummed tones <br>
fossilized paws beneath <br>
my feet, a springs <br>

<img src="image/barton.jpeg"/>

scent of the pine <br>
twilight sways with wind <br>
cresting a rocky giant <br>

crickets at my feet <br>
flutters the bush warbler <br>
-- a piny refuge <br>
