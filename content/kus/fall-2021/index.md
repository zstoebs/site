# fall

numbing :: I feel nothing but feel the numbness <br>

nine friends <br>
bathing in the pool <br>
of fallen oak leaves <br>

flock of birds <br>
leaves in the wind <br>
shift in unison <br>

seventieth page <br>
the answer to my problem <br>
on an oak leaf <br>

hard stare <br>
my mind-body is zen <br>
autumn blows in <br>

different pretty <br>
shaped pink geranium <br>
in autumn twilight <br>

yellow maple <br>
blesses us all <br>
with autumn <br>

broken toe <br>
on my 24th birthday <br>
Autumn’s rebirth <br>

sometimes <br>
   -- it all just comes <br>
together <br>

in one house, for moving beings <br>
    still autumn breeze <br>
    
my beginning ahead, gaze up my journey’s trail, behind my ends <br>

cornucopia : <br>
i love that word <br>
so much <br>

gradient <br>
from the autumn maple <br>
cone's tip <br>

small red fruit <br>
infect leafless branches <br>
of a Yule tree <br>
