# spring

gods falling <br>
from the sky -- <br>
water rushes <br>

<img src="image/berries.JPG" />

spring mother : <br>
carried bags of groceries <br>
her sun babies <br>

<img src="image/robin.JPG" />

my spirit animal <br>
found his heavenly rest : <br>
the spring robin <br>

<img src="image/lantern.JPG" />

the green samurai -- <br>
nears me with day light <br>
and his stone <br>

# summer

equivocation : to some I’m “weird,” or even “cool” <br>
