ear wind of walking through plain of grass | overhead <br>

<img src="image/falls.JPG" />

daddy fishing :: <br>
a Star in my lens <br>
before the falls <br>

city search <br>
for sex sounds and sin : <br>
morning cloud ahead <br>

The Mat <br>
is an Ontology <br>
for Yoga <br>

---

body aches <br>
under oppressive light <br>
of clear winter <br>

<img src="image/fire.JPG" />

pupils burn <br>
as cold sun peers <br>
behind branches <br>

---

flock of days <br>
already far away <br>
still undone <br>

blue fields <br>
of teeming aura <br>
bestow: life <br>

peace found <br>
in a puff jacket -- <br>
winter’s green <br>

alone in bed <br>
but not my own :: <br>
drunk head <br>

open heart <br>
pasted to the window <br>
one eye open <br>

---

zen numbness <br>
after my youth, cathartic <br>
hairy sex <br>

storm’s warmth <br>
after my abandon youth <br>
at winter’s end <br>

---

a cloudy sky : <br>
offering clarity <br>
never known <br>

feather wisps <br>
courting chirps at last :: <br>
only edges freeze <br>
