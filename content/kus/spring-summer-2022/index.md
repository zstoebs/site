# spring

purple blooms | <br>
for the first time <br>
in years <br>
they crunch beneath <br>
my old-aged thoughts <br>

my sum of work <br>
traverses two pages :: <br>
last Tennessee spring <br>

air hums <br>
in cosmic threads <br>
at midnight <br>


# summer 

sweet smell <br>
of white wildflowers <br>
~«~«≈…‡…‡…‡ <br>

blue moons <br>
eclipse at an angle <br>
then move away

internal forces <br>
full moon in Pisces <br>
: quit deluding! <br>

birds flock <br>
to cedar leaves, <br>
one last go <br>
