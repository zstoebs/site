# spring

spring’s robins -- <br>
seeding the university soil  <br>
my heart! <br>

raw bloom -- <br>
the stately robin <br>
careens <br>

chapter ends <br>
because nobody seems to remember <br>
what happened <br>

a sharp edge just begging to make a cut. <br>
the cold hurts <br>

# summer

the wildfire -- rays leave skin red and irradiated <br>

you have commitment <br>
lacking in dialogue : <br>
or so he said <br>

slithering sweat <br>
weaves from tree to tree : <br>
spotted light <br>

lone zinnia <br>
against the mad king <br>
he stands so tall <br>
