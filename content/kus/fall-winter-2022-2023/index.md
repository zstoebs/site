# fall

<img src="image/atx_geese.jpeg" />

noble warrior <br>
Thisis, solemn and true -- <br>
great autumn oak <br>
guardian on the river's vanishing edge <br>
hear his cry, a plea for esteem <br>

betrayal, reveals <br>
the flower of anger <br>
a true being <br>

Stillness <br>
in fall’s ancient air, <br>
Symmetry <br>

wheel grinds <br>
the autumn windstorm <br>
Beneath her feet <br>

looking out <br>
these big moments -- <br>
seem so small <br>

breeze on skin -- <br>
peace on surface water <br>
one long summer <br>

gasp out front <br>
white lake line murmurs, <br>
flowers whistle <br>

orphaned leaves dancing <br>
a war in overhead grass <br>
dots the orange sky <br>

# winter

unknown purpose - <br>
they search for so long <br>
in a cloudy sky <br>

<img src="image/desk.jpeg" />

hummingbird dodges, <br>
coursing standstill raindrops, <br>
please flip switch the spring! <br>
