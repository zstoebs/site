swordsmen sing <br>
among equinox flowers <br>
a fawn forages <br>

specter sets a trap <br>
around corners grow shadows <br>
no moon in skull town <br>

scale, fearless <br>
that spiny slope, unbowed <br>
hand pyramid, firm <br>

walking faster <br>
by cutting corners <br>
of acute sidewalks <br>

swollen with sugar <br>
lazy day leaves strange aftertaste <br>
an inside moral war <br>

how to write haiku <br>
without ever stepping outside <br>
I ran so far away <br>

the big hungry winter	cuddle then devour <br>
upend my dirty growl	behind my angry howl <br>

warm hearth <br>
filled with stronger fire -- <br>
hope in overcast skies <br>

little in this world decided by one person <br>
too much is <br>
