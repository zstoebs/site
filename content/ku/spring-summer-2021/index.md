# spring

dogwoods wish petals <br>
sending warm love -- <br>
ambient footsteps <br>

first crop -- <br>
gradually startles  <br>
a Conscience <br>
dreams of farms and glory <br>
sweaty sinews; love’s rhythm <br>

---

two days in a row <br>
battle, good and evil <br>
no grey in community <br>

past shame <br>
some how withers <br>
I harden <br>

will I ever be enough? <br>

---

first world problem  <br>
is privilege knowing <br>
life ends well <br>

how long?  <br>
my child trains <br>
dimensions <br>

filtered  <br>
... unfiltered <br>
filter <br>

# summer

dogwood blooms -- <br>
loving each other, overflowing <br>
the edge of the pond <br>

residential concrete <br>
crow caws to robin <br>
unfenced front yard <br>

words light the gas <br>
doubt billows from the subcortex -- <br>
gloom sizzles inside <br>

cloudy waves  <br>
their turbulent serenity <br>
reflecting lifetime <br>

serotonin <br>
spurs  <br>
inspiration ... <br>
for <br>
sunburnt <br>
shoulders <br>

Haiku summer -- <br>
Reading poet’s names <br>
A big world <br>

building your own website <br>
= pure ontology <br>

atop a slant <br>
there is the hospital <br>
storm ... pending <br>

binary songbird : <br>
leaps from signpost to branch <br>
on leeward gust <br>

city’s peace :  <br>
my father’s infinite chagrin <br>
vanishes <br>

phone eats first the simple dishes are rarely bland <br>

ball moss... <br>
between my fingertips <br>
springs trickle <br>

image search <br>
is mother of us all -- <br>
in a desolate scape <br>

heat in the shade -- <br>
cocktail opposed to coffee <br>
shunning me again <br>

pixel rain <br>
falling to a dubstep beat <br>
L, L L <br>

hacking away <br>
at wood and python <br> 
also my forehead <br>

poems are my spells cast away free <br>

chilly morning dew : <br>
shapes the river valley <br>
crescent of clouds <br>

summer eve --  <br>
together on the wood <br>
the taste of sambal <br>

warmth of coffee <br>
at the Korean market <br>
a heartfelt friend <br>
