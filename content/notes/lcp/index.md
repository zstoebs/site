**tl;dr** This Fall 2021, I am taking a course on computational game theory, which insofar is the formulation of bimatrix and Stackelberg games as mathematical programs and the algorithms that solve them, or approximate solutions. Linear complementarity problems are the foundation for computing Nash equilibria which are solutions to simple games, i.e., bimatrix games.
