**tl;dr** My guide to effective brand management -- the tenets, epiphanies, and fruits of my efforts -- a reflection of tasteful pride and confidence -- a learning policy optimized over 24 years. 

# Morning Routine
My first objective for any day is to warm my brain up with a few bitesized games. Otherwise, it's a slow process getting out of bed and motivating myself for the day because I'm not much of a morning person. 

Daily:
1. [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
2. [Octordle](https://octordle.com)
3. [Chess](https://www.chess.com/daily-chess-puzzle)

Occasionally:
1. [Sudoku](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/hard)
2. [Solitaire](https://games.washingtonpost.com/en-us/games/daily-solitaire)
3. [Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org)

*Sudoku and Solitaire used to be daily for me but they became tedious. Semantle is more challenging to solve but lower stakes, rather lasting the whole day when I have time to guess or think of a good semantic candidate.*

# Tenets
I'm consistently optimizing, little by little. Serendipitously, I started thinking about some of these ideas as a kid. Although steadfast adherence helps me endure sometimes, I am constantly updating and reevaluating because things change and people can do hard things... such as admitting that I am wrong or that a tenet that I lived my life by up until now may not be optimal anymore. 

## Core
- Under no circumstances will I suffer religious zealotry, homophobia, or bigotry.
- Empathy, kindness, forgiveness, flexibility, and adaptability are more logical and worthwhile than apathy, hate, vindictiveness, rigidity, and immutability.
- I am an experience- and purpose-oriented person, less of a results- and -appearance oriented person, yet I am cognizant that the latter is advantageous in some contexts.
- <strong>Science, engineering, and math are the most fulfilling and constant themes of my life.</strong>
- My family by birth is important to me. 
- <strong>My physical fitness, diet, and mental health are intertwined and are core to who I am.</strong>
- In frustrating situations, stepping back mentally, and sometimes physically, often helps me see the macro-perspective to explore my best path moving forward. 
- The most fun and approachable to building complex systems is to solve problems modularly and abstractly, starting with the small easy components in abstract terms to lay a strong foundation, understanding, toolkit, etc. from which to build the rest. For me, it all comes together with significantly less frustration if I have tools instrument my objectives. 

## Observations
- My lifestyle is healthy, yet improvable... and non-negotiable.
- A workout + music / podcast is my critical grounding mechanism, centering meditation, and emotional balancer.
- I don't have to work out every day.
- I like to eat chocolate and all macarons.
	- The two genius foods of our day: chocolate + peanut butter and sea salt chocolate chip cookies.
- Cutting and bulking cycles are not conducive to my mental well-being. 
	- I like to exercise consistently, maintain my diet, and feel physically healthy all year.
	- Almond milk and plant protein feel better to my body than cow's milk and whey protein.
- Few video games provide real value to my life as an adult, but many were critical to my growth as a youth.
	- But I watch battle royales on Twitch like straight men watch football. 
	- And the lessons and enjoyment gained from the rare role-playing game with a phenomenal story are valuable to me. 
- <strong>Brand. Marketing. Is key.</strong>

## Corrigenda
- I am relatively terrible at time management.
- I have difficulty focusing, unless I am very excited by the task at hand, even if I want to do it.
