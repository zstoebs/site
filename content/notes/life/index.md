**tl;dr** My guide to effective brand management -- the tenets, epiphanies, and fruits of my efforts -- a reflection of tasteful pride and confidence -- a learning policy optimized over 24 years. 

# Life
- I am very, very lucky. 
- I am gay, very sexy, very smart, and very fun.
- Under no circumstances will I suffer religious zealotry, homophobia, or bigotry.
- Empathy, kindness, forgiveness, flexibility, and adaptability are more logical and worthwhile than apathy, hate, vindictiveness, rigidity, and immutability.
- I am an experience- and purpose-oriented person, less of a results- and -appearance oriented person, yet I am cognizant that the latter is advantageous in some contexts.
- <strong>Science, engineering, and math are the most fulfilling and constant themes of my life.</strong>
- My family by birth is important to me. 
- <strong>My physical fitness, diet, and mental health are intertwined and are core to who I am.</strong>
- In frustrating situations, stepping back mentally, and sometimes physically, often helps me see the macro-perspective to explore my best path moving forward. 

# Lifestyle
- My lifestyle is healthy, yet improvable... and non-negotiable.
- A workout + music / podcast is my critical grounding mechanism, centering meditation, and emotional balancer.
- I don't have to work out every day.
- I like to eat chocolate and all macarons.
	- The two genius foods of our day: chocolate + peanut butter and sea salt chocolate chip cookies.
- Cutting and bulking cycles are not conducive to my mental well-being. 
	- I like to exercise consistently, maintain my diet, and feel physically healthy all year.
	- Almond milk and plant protein feel better to my body than cow's milk and whey protein, even though I am not lactose-intolerant.
- Few video games provide real value to my life as an adult, but many were critical to my growth as a youth.
	- But I watch battle royales on Twitch like straight men watch football. 
	- And the lessons and enjoyment gained from the rare role-playing game with a phenomenal story are valuable to me. 
- <strong>Brand. Marketing. Is key.</strong>

# Corrigenda
- I am relatively terrible at time management.
- I have difficulty focusing, unless I am very excited by the task at hand, even if I want to do it.
