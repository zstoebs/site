**tl;dr** My guide to effective brand management -- the tenets, epiphanies, and fruits of my efforts -- a reflection of tasteful pride and confidence -- a learning policy optimized over 24 years. 

# Morning Routine
I'm not much of a morning person so I have to warm my brain up with a few bitesized games. Otherwise, it's a slow process getting out of bed and motivating myself for the day. My ride-or-dies: 

- [Chess.com Daily Puzzle](https://www.chess.com/daily-chess-puzzle)
- [NYT Daily Hard Sudoku](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/hard)

# Tenets
I'm consistently optimizing, little by little. Serendipitously, I started thinking about some of these ideas as a kid. Although steadfast adherence helps me endure sometimes, I am updating and reevaluating because things change and people can do hard things... such as admitting that I am wrong or that a tenet that I lived my life by up until now may not be optimal anymore. 

## Core
- Under no circumstances will I suffer religious zealotry, homophobia, or bigotry.
- Empathy, kindness, forgiveness, flexibility, and adaptability are more logical and worthwhile than apathy, hate, vindictiveness, rigidity, and immutability.
- I am an experience- and purpose-oriented person, less of a results- and -appearance oriented person, yet I am cognizant that the latter is advantageous in some contexts.
    - I have to love what I'm doing, even the small things.
- <strong>Science, engineering, and math are the most fulfilling and constant themes of my life.</strong>
- My family by birth is important to me, as is my chosen family. 
- <strong>My physical fitness, diet, and mental health are intertwined and are core to who I am.</strong>
- In frustrating situations, stepping back mentally, and sometimes physically, helps me see the macro-perspective, to remind me of my reasons and to explore <i>my</i> best path forward. 
- To build systems, I solve problems modularly and abstractly. For me, it all comes together with significantly less frustration if I have implemented a set of tools to instrument my objectives... and makes the code more appealing. 
    - I am amused by <i>bespoke</i> code. ifykyk. 

## Observations
- My lifestyle is healthy, yet improvable... and non-negotiable.
- A workout + music / podcast / audiobook is my critical grounding mechanism, centering meditation, and emotional balancer.
- I don't have to work out every day.
- I like to eat chocolate and all macarons.
	- The two genius food combos of our day: chocolate + peanut butter and sea salt + chocolate chips.
- Cutting and bulking cycles are not conducive to my mental well-being. 
	- I like to exercise consistently, maintain my diet, and feel physically healthy all year.
	- Almond milk and plant protein feel better to my body than cow's milk and whey protein.
- Some video games provide real value to my life as an adult and many were critical to my growth as a youth.
	- I watch battle royales on Twitch like straight men watch sports. 
	- The lessons and enjoyment gained from the rare role-playing game with a phenomenal story are valuable to me. 
- <strong>Brand. Marketing. Is key.</strong>  
- I love F1. Go Mercedes, go Hamilton!
