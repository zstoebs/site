# Background
Although autonomous vehicles are the talk of the town these days, the methodologies behind them are elusive to most. To help yourself, I suggest reading my note on [LCPs](/notes/lcp) and then follow that up with section 3.1 of this thesis on [LMCPs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiKzsKEztX0AhVUTDABHbt3DrEQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fescholarship.mcgill.ca%2Fdownloads%2F2z10ws808&usg=AOvVaw3x3QL54b3sOErLRdSzTeO5) and the [path solver for MCPs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250889964_The_path_solver_a_nommonotone_stabilization_scheme_for_mixed_complementarity_problems).
