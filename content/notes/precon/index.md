# overview of preconditioning

Preconditioning adjusts the state of a model to {expedite, improve, stabilize} convergence of an optimization procedure, typically by adjusting the gradient in the update rule with the inverse of the Hessian.  

## Newton method

## Quasi-Newton method

# polynomial preconditioning

## Conjugate gradient

## proximal gradient descent
